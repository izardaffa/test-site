    <p>"Gotoubun no Hanayome" (五等分の花嫁), also known as "The Quintessential Quintuplets," is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Negi Haruba. The manga was serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine from August 2017 to February 2019. It was later adapted into an anime television series.</p>
    <p>The story revolves around a high school student named Fuutarou Uesugi, who is hired as a private tutor for a set of quintuplets—Ichika, Nino, Miku, Yotsuba, and Itsuki Nakano. The quintuplets, despite being sisters, have vastly different personalities and academic abilities. Fuutarou faces the challenge of helping them improve their grades while navigating the complexities of their individual characters.</p>
    <p>The series gained popularity for its comedic elements, romantic tension, and the mystery surrounding the identity of the bride-to-be, whom Fuutarou marries in the future. The plot often involves misunderstandings, comedic situations, and emotional moments as the characters grow closer.</p>
    <p>As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, the manga had concluded, and the anime adaptation covered the story up to a certain point. Keep in mind that there might be additional developments or releases beyond that date. If you're a fan, you may want to check for the latest information to see if there have been any new manga volumes, anime seasons, or related projects.</p>
